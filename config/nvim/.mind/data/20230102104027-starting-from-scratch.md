# starting_from_scratch

## start with a feature, not a layout

- instead of starting with the shell, start with a piece of actual functionality

1. Pick a feature

- friend requests: sending, receiving, denying, pending...

2. Think about what the interface for that feature needs

- think of one feature/component:

  - think about the data you have
  - think about what you show to the user
  - think about what response you get

- make a markup

## detail comes later

- in the early stages of a design don't make low level decisions
  - typefaces
  - shadows
  - icons
- if apps make it difficult use a sharpie and white page

- **Hold the color**

  - while you might think you are ready to start using colors, don't
  - in greyscale, you will be using spacing, contrast and size to do all the heavy lifting

- **Don't over invest**
  - the whole point to low-fidelity is to be able to design quickly and start building
